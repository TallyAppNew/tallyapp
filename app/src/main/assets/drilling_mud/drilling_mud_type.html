<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Some
wells require different types to be used at different parts in the
hole, or for some types to be used in combination with others. The
various types of fluid generally fall into a few broad categories :</font></font></p>
<ul>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Air
	: Compressed air is pumped either down the bore hole's annular space
	or down the drill
	string itself.</font></font></p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Air/water
	: The same as above, with water added to increase viscosity, flush
	the hole, provide more cooling, and/or to control dust.</font></font></p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Air/polymer
	: A specially formulated chemical, most often referred to as a type
	of polymer, is added to the water and air mixture to create specific
	conditions. A foaming agent is a good example of a polymer.</font></font></p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Water
	: Water by itself is sometimes used. In offshore drilling, seawater
	is typically used while drilling the top section of the hole.</font></font></p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Water-based
	mud (WBM) : Most basic water-based mud systems begin with water,
	then clays and other chemicals are incorporated into the water to
	create a homogeneous blend resembling something between chocolate
	milk and a malt (depending on viscosity). The clay is usually a
	combination of native clays that are suspended in the fluid while
	drilling, or specific types of clay that are processed and sold as
	additives for the WBM system. The most common of these is bentonite,
	frequently referred to in the oilfield as &quot;gel.&quot; Gel
	likely makes reference to the fact that while the fluid is being
	pumped, it can be very thin and free-flowing (like chocolate milk),
	though when pumping is stopped, the static fluid builds a &quot;gel&quot;
	structure that resists flow. When an adequate pumping force is
	applied to &quot;break the gel,&quot; flow resumes and the fluid
	returns to its previously free-flowing state. Many other chemicals
	(e.g. potassium
	formate) are added to a WBM system to achieve various effects,
	including: viscosity control, shale stability, enhance drilling rate
	of penetration, and cooling and lubricating of equipment.</font></font></p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0in">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Oil-based
	mud (OBM) : Oil-based mud is a mud where the base fluid is a
	petroleum product such as diesel fuel. Oil-based muds are used for
	many reasons, including increased lubricity, enhanced shale
	inhibition, and greater cleaning abilities with less viscosity.
	Oil-based muds also withstand greater heat without breaking down.
	The use of oil-based muds has special considerations, including
	cost, environmental considerations such as disposal of cuttings in
	an appropriate place, and the exploratory disadvantages of using
	oil-based mud, especially in wildcat wells. Using an oil-based mud
	interferes with the geochemical analysis of cuttings and cores and
	with the determination of API
	gravity because the base fluid cannot be distinguished from oil
	that is returned from the formation.</font></font></p>
	<li><p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
	<font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Synthetic-based
	fluid (SBM) (Otherwise known as Low Toxicity Oil Based Mud or LTOBM)
	: Synthetic-based fluid is a mud in which the base fluid is a
	synthetic oil. This is most often used on offshore rigs because it
	has the properties of an oil-based mud, but the toxicity of the
	fluid fumes are much less than an oil-based fluid. This is important
	when the drilling crew works with the fluid in an enclosed space
	such as an offshore drilling rig. Synthetic-based fluid poses the
	same environmental and analysis problems as oil-based fluid.</font></font></p>

through the drill string, where it sprays out of nozzles on the drill
bit, thus cleaning and cooling the drill bit in the process. The mud
then carries the crushed or cut rock (&quot;cuttings&quot;) up the
annular space (&quot;annulus&quot;) between the drill string and the
sides of the hole being drilled, up through the surface </font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">casing,</font></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

The mud pits let the drilled &quot;fines&quot; settle; the pits are
also where the fluid is treated by adding chemicals and other
substances. </font></font>
